# Spelunker Unearthed
An in-development procedurally generated dungeon crawler with text-based graphics

## What is this?
This project aims to create a well-designed, fun-to-play game and develop a fully custom game engine based on MonoGame, named MariEngine. 
The game is being developed as a means to learn how game engines work, to design and implement clean and modular architectures and... just to have fun with C#!

## Demo
Short demo of the engine's new audio capabilities, showing off almost all of the game and engine's features as of the time of recording. 
The video demonstrates the game's dynamic reverb system, where the engine evaluates a sound's surroundings to determine how much it should reverberate to give a sense of scale of the room where the sound was played.
**Use headphones** for the best experience.
